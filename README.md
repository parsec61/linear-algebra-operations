# Linear Algebra Operations

This mini-course is intended for students who would like a refresher on the basics of linear algebra. The course attempts to provide the motivation for “why” linear algebra is important in addition to “what” linear algebra is.

Students will learn concepts in linear algebra by applying them in computer programs. At the end of the course, you will have coded your own personal library of linear algebra functions that you can use to solve real-world problems.
